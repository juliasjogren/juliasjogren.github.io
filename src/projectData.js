This project is made with PIXI.js, which was very interesting both to learn more about the creation engine and also get a deeper understanding for how different components of a system work together. There are still a few things to do until its complete but the game is available to play with a friend. Roll the die and use the best tactics to be the one who first get their markers to their home.",

It can be desribed as a modern version of Space Invaders we made the game in unity with C# for the game and a PHP backend.
